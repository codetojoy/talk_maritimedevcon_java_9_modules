### Post-Talk Notes

* Note that reflection is allowed in Jigsaw, but it must be explicitly granted ([example here](https://github.com/codetojoy/talk_maritimedevcon_java_9_modules/blob/master/eg_03_2_java_9_open_module/src/com.acme.bids.db/module-info.java)). There wasn't time to cover this aspect, and there was a question about this afterwards.
