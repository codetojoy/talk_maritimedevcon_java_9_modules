### Java 9 Modules For Busy Developers

*UPDATED:* Java 9 is scheduled for release in July 2017. The intent _was_ to include the long-awaited Java Platform Module System (JPMS, aka Project Jigsaw). However, in a dramatic twist on May 8, JPMS lost a public JCP vote, with Red Hat, IBM, and others insisting that JPMS is not yet ready. The web is ablaze with open letters, blog posts, and varying worldviews on what's best for the Java ecosystem. Per JCP process, Oracle has thirty days after the vote to amend the proposal. Exciting times!

In this talk, we'll examine the motivation for Project Jigsaw and its features. We'll analyze the criticism and political landscape; we'll consider module alternatives (e.g. OSGi). And most importantly, we'll discuss *what this means* for busy Java developers like you and me. (Please note: this talk will not be as code-centric as originally conceived in April 2017, though many code samples will be available on GitHub.)
