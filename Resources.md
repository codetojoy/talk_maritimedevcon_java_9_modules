### Ancient Artifacts

Quotes below are intended to illustrate that this has been a long-term discussion; the intent is not to 'take sides'.

* JUN-2009, [Java Posse: Jigsaw and JSR 294 Interview](http://javaposse.com/java_posse_259_jigsaw_and_jsr_294_interview), Mark Reinhold, Alex Buckley (Oracle)
    * (paraphrased) _White elephant in the room is OSGi_, Dick Wall near 4m20s 
    * (paraphrased) _Some of the opinions coming out of that [OSGi] community don't agree with some of our requirements_, Mark Reinhold near 30m40s
    * (paraphrased) _If OSGi had everything we needed, we wouldn't be doing Jigsaw_, Mark Reinhold near 34m30s
    * (paraphrased) _People at the center of [OSGi community] have come to understand, even if we disagree. But there is a crowd in the blogsphere that ... at the instant of any disagreement, get extremely defensive._, Mark Reinhold near 36m25s 
* DEC-2008, [Project Jigsaw blog post](http://mreinhold.org/blog/jigsaw), Mark Reinhold (Oracle)
* APR-2008, [Java Posse: OSGi](http://javaposse.com/java_posse_245_os_gi_interview), Peter Kriens, B.J. Hargrave
    * (paraphrased) What is OSGi? _Three layers: a modular component system ... a lifecycle for dynamic management ... and a service-oriented programming model_, B.J. Hargrave near 1m45s
    * (paraphrased) _The Idea is to create a system where applicatons from different vendors ... can collaborate without prior agreement between the parties_, Peter Kriens near 3m00s

* _Many people claim OSGi is hard without acknowledging that modularizing applications is the hard part. ... JSR 376 will demonstrate that OSGi was just the messenger and actually not the cause._ - Peter Kriens.
